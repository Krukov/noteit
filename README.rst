--------------------------------
The tool for simple store some notes
--------------------------------

That tool I created for my own purposes, but I will glad if you will use it too.

I love commandline tools like `howdoi <https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi>`_ or `fuckit <https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy>`_, they are really awesome.
Sometimes we want to note something simple, some usefull: command like *tar zxvf* or password from some service(it is bad idea), and that it will be great, if you can make this note simple and fast, and than get this note anywhere. So, take this tool and enjoy!
