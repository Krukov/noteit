old noteit - create and get notes anywhere 
======================================

Make Notes with CLI (zero dependence)
------------------------------------

I created this tool for my own purposes, but I will be glad if you'll use it too.

I love commandline tools like `howdoi <https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi>`_ , they are really awesome.
Sometimes it is necessary to note something simple and useful: commands like *tar zxvf* or any password. That would be great, if you could make a note simple and fast, and then get it anywhere. I hope, you will enjoy this tool!


Why
===

* \:package: Minimal dependence and size (about 7 kb), all you need is python
* \:snake: Support python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4 and upper (for 2.6 you need to install argparse package)
* \:rocket: Easy to install (curl --silent --show-error --retry 5 http://krukov.pythonanywhere.com//install.sh | sudo sh)
* \:beginner: Easy to use
* \:closed_lock_with_key: Secure. Encrypt your notes by default (you can use your own key)
* >_ CLI - that's awesome. Work at all platforms (I hope)

How it works
-------------

When you run noteit at first time he goes to the noteit-backend host with basic auth headers and automatically registers
you at the service. After that he gets token from server and saves it locally at your home directory, generates and saves double md5
hash of your credentials for continue uses by key for using by encryption key. Than noteit using saved token for
authorization. All encrypted notes stored at noteit backend server, that's why you can get it anywhere you want.
Every note has an alias, you can determine it by option '-a' or backend will generate random alias.


Security
--------

All notes encrypted by saved hash of you password (at backend another hash stored) or by key from '--key' option.
You can disable encryption with option '--do-not-encrypt' manually.
